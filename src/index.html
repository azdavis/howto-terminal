			How to Use the Terminal
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			The terminal is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with their
			computer through simply typing commands. In this guide, you will learn
			basic terminal commands that you can use to navigate through your
			filesystem, as well as manipulate objects within your filesystem.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Initial Setup
		</h2>
		<h3>Linux</h3>
		<p>
			Linux already has the terminal built in, so you can open it by pressing
			Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard.
		</p>
		<h3>Mac</h3>
		<p>
			Mac already has the terminal built in, so you can open it by opening your
			"Applications" folder, then opening your "Utilities" folder and clicking
			on "Terminal".
		</p>
		<h3>Windows</h3>
		<p>
			You will need to download and install MobaXterm. It can be downloaded
			<a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net">here</a>. Open MobaXterm and start
			a new session by clicking the "Session" button in the top left corner of
			the screen. For the session type, select SSH. For the remote host, type
			your Andrew ID followed by "@unix.andrew.cmu.edu" (It should look like
			andrewid@unix.andrew.cmu.edu). You will then be prompted to enter your
			password. Once entered, you will have access to the terminal.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Usage
		</h2>
		<p>
			Now that you understand the motivation for these instructions and have
			gotten your terminal set up, we may introduce some basic terminology and
			commands with some examples.
		</p>
		<p>
			Open up your terminal. Note that your cursor should be inside the terminal
			window, ready for you to type.
		</p>
		<p>
			The short line of text before the cursor is called the 'prompt'. It often
			contains information like what user is currently logged in, or what
			directory you are in. It is usually terminated with the $ character. In
			the following examples, we will use the $ character on the beginning of a
			line to indicate the prompt.
		</p>
		<p>Type 'echo hello' and press Enter. The result should look like this:</p>
		<pre>
$ echo hello
hello</pre
		>
		<p>
			Here you have used your first command. The echo command simply prints out
			what you give it (in this case, 'hello'). The things that you give
			commands are called 'arguments', so in this case, we would say 'hello' is
			an argument to the echo command. In general, commands may be given zero or
			more arguments, separated by spaces.
		</p>
		<p>
			You will notice that after the command finished, a new prompt (with a new
			$) was prepared for you to type your next command.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next command we will learn is pwd, which stands for 'print working
			directory' or 'present working directory'. It takes no arguments and
			prints the working directory. (You may know 'directory' by its street
			name, 'folder'.) Try it in your terminal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let us change the working directory. First we will make a new directory
			with the aptly-named mkdir. Try 'mkdir testing'. If you see no output,
			then the directory was successfully created. But if you see an error
			message, like
		</p>
		<pre>
$ mkdir testing
mkdir: cannot create directory 'testing': File exists</pre
		>
		<p>
			Then indeed, the directory was not created because something with that
			name already existed. Try different names until you don't get errors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you find a directory name that works, we may change our working
			directory to that directory. For that, we will use the cd command, where
			cd stands for 'change directory'. cd (usually) takes 1 argument, the name
			of the directory you wish to enter.
		</p>
		<p>For instance, if you created the directory 'testing', type</p>
		<pre>$ cd testing</pre>
		<p>
			After you cd, use pwd again to show the working directory and note that it
			has changed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now you might be wondering, what if I want to get out of the testing
			directory and go back to my last directory. The command that you want to
			type is:
		</p>
		<pre>$ cd ..</pre>
		<p>
			Here, cd still stands for "change directory", but what are the two dots
			after that? Those two dots are used to denote the parent directory, which
			is the directory one level above. Hence, after typing "cd testing" and "cd
			..", we will see that we are back in our original directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you would like, you may remove the directory you created with 'rmdir'.
			For instance, you may say
		</p>
		<pre>$ rmdir testing</pre>
		<p>
			But note that if the directory has files or other directories inside it,
			rmdir will refuse to remove the indicated directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			To remove a directory and all of its contents, we must recurse into the
			directory, remove everything in the directory, and then remove the (now
			empty) directory itself. For this, we may use the 'rm' command, paired
			with the '-r' (recursive) option. For instance:
		</p>
		<pre>$ rm -r testing</pre>
		<p>
			If the thing you wish to remove is just a regular file, you may simply use
			'rm' with no options. That is, 'rm foo.txt' if 'foo.txt' is some file.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, suppose you would like to open a file from your current directory,
			but you don't remember what is the name of that file. Wouldn't it be nice
			if there's a way to view what are the files and subdirectories that are in
			your current directory? Try typing in the following:
		</p>
		<pre>
$ ls
testing</pre
		>
		<p>
			The command "ls" stands for list, which can be used to list everything we
			have in our current directory. Since we just created a folder called
			"testing", we will see that printed out in our terminal. You might see
			additional file names if you have them in your directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			These are the basic commands that you will need to know to navigate your
			folders. You might be wondering what's the point of terminal if you can do
			all of these by clicking on your folders. Hold that thought, because
			terminal is way more powerful than that. It has many more advanced
			commands that can do very powerful things. We are going to pick a few of
			those just to show you a glimpse of what you can do.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's try to create a file in our testing directory (hopefully you should
			be able to know how to get there by now). Use your favourite word editor
			to create a file named "a.txt" inside your testing directory, and write
			the words "I am using the terminal" anywhere in the file.
		</p>
		<p>Next, try typing in the following:</p>
		<pre>
$ grep terminal a.txt
I am using the terminal</pre
		>
		<p>
			You should be able to see the line you just typed in display on the
			command line! What the "grep" command does is that it searches for the
			string "terminal in the file a.txt, and print out all lines with the
			string in it. Try it yourself by adding a few more lines to a.txt and run
			the grep command again. See if the output matches with your expectation!
		</p>
		<p>
			One thing that you may want to do is to search through all your files for
			a specific string. Say if you are a student, and you really want to search
			through all your course notes to find the quadratic formula. But there are
			50 chapters of course notes with hundreds of pages in each chapter. What
			you can do is this:
		</p>
		<pre>$ grep -r quadratic .</pre>
		<p>
			What the above grep command does is it will look through all the files
			residing in your current directory, look for the string "quadratic", and
			print them all out along with the filename. The "-r" flag is used to
			indicate that you want to search through every single file in your current
			directory, in every subdirectory, and in every subdirectory of every
			subdirectory etc. Note that the . refers to the current directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			The end.
