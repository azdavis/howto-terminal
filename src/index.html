			How to Use the Terminal
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Introduction
		</h2>
		<p>
			The terminal is a powerful tool that allows users to interact with their
			computer through simply typing commands. In this guide, you will learn
			basic terminal commands that you can use to navigate through your
			filesystem, as well as manipulate objects within your filesystem.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Initial Setup
		</h2>
		<h3>Linux</h3>
		<p>
			Linux already has the terminal built in, so you can open it by pressing
			Control-Alt-T on your keyboard.
		</p>
		<h3>Mac</h3>
		<p>
			Mac already has the terminal built in, so you can open it by opening your
			"Applications" folder, then opening your "Utilities" folder and clicking
			on "Terminal".
		</p>
		<h3>Windows</h3>
		<p>
			You will need to download and install MobaXterm. It can be downloaded
			<a href="https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net">here</a>. Open MobaXterm and start
			a new session by clicking the "Session" button in the top left corner of
			the screen. For the session type, select SSH. For the remote host, type
			your Andrew ID followed by "@unix.andrew.cmu.edu" (It should look like
			andrewid@unix.andrew.cmu.edu). You will then be prompted to enter your
			password. Once entered, you will have access to the terminal.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Usage
		</h2>
		<p>
			Now that you understand the motivation for these instructions and have
			gotten your terminal set up, we may introduce some basic terminology and
			commands with some examples.
		</p>
		<p>
			Open up your terminal. Note that your cursor should be inside the terminal
			window, ready for you to type.
		</p>
		<p>
			The short line of text before the cursor is called the 'prompt'. It often
			contains information like what user is currently logged in, or what
			directory you are in. It is usually terminated with the $ character. In
			the following examples, we will use the $ character on the beginning of a
			line to indicate the prompt.
		</p>
		<h3>echo</h3>
		<p>Type 'echo hello' and press Enter. The result should look like this:</p>
		<pre>
$ echo hello
hello</pre
		>
		<p>
			Here you have used your first command. The echo command simply prints out
			what you give it (in this case, 'hello'). The things that you give
			commands are called 'arguments', so in this case, we would say 'hello' is
			an argument to the echo command. In general, commands may be given zero or
			more arguments, separated by spaces.
		</p>
		<p>
			You will notice that after the command finished, a new prompt (with a new
			$) was prepared for you to type your next command.
		</p>
		<h3>pwd</h3>
		<p>
			The next command we will learn is pwd, which stands for 'print working
			directory' or 'present working directory'. It takes no arguments and
			prints the path of the working directory. (You may know 'directory' by its
			street name, 'folder'.) Try it in your terminal.
		</p>
		<h3>ls</h3>
		<p>
			The ls command lists the contents of a directory. When you give ls no
			arguments, it lists the contents of the current directory.
		</p>
		<h3>mkdir</h3>
		<p>
			You can make new directories with the aptly-named mkdir. Try 'mkdir
			testing'. If you see no output, then the directory was successfully
			created. But if you see an error message, like
		</p>
		<pre>
$ mkdir testing
mkdir: cannot create directory 'testing': File exists</pre
		>
		<p>
			Then indeed, the directory was not created because something with that
			name already existed. Try different names until you don't get errors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you're done, you can use ls again and verify that the new directory
			was created.
		</p>
		<h3>cd</h3>
		<p>
			You may now change our working directory to that directory. For that, you
			may use the cd command, where cd stands for 'change directory'. cd
			(usually) takes 1 argument, the name of the directory you wish to enter.
		</p>
		<p>For instance, if you created the directory 'testing', type</p>
		<pre>$ cd testing</pre>
		<p>
			After you cd, use pwd again to show the working directory and note that it
			has changed. You can also use ls to show the contents of this new
			directory - but note that the directory is empty, so there's nothing to
			show.
		</p>
		<p>
			To change the working directory to the parent directory (the directory
			that contains the current directory), use:
		</p>
		<pre>$ cd ..</pre>
		<p>
			We use the cd command as expected to change our current directory, and
			'..' denotes the parent directory. We can now ls and pwd to see we're back
			where we started.
		</p>
		<h3>rmdir</h3>
		<p>
			We may remove the directory we created with 'rmdir'. For instance, you may
			say
		</p>
		<pre>$ rmdir testing</pre>
		<p>
			But note that if the directory has files or other directories inside it,
			rmdir will refuse to remove the indicated directory.
		</p>
		<h3>touch</h3>
		<p>We now know how to make and remove directories, but what about files?</p>
		<p>To create a file, we may use touch.</p>
		<h3>cat</h3>
		<h3>rm</h3>
		<p>And to remove a file, we may use rm.</p>
		<p>
			These are the basic commands that you will need to know to navigate your
			folders. You might be wondering what's the point of terminal if you can do
			all of these by clicking on your folders. Hold that thought, because
			terminal is way more powerful than that. It has many more advanced
			commands that can do very powerful things. We are going to pick a few of
			those just to show you a glimpse of what you can do.
		</p>
		<h3>grep</h3>
		<p>
			First, let us make a new file called file.txt. We can do that right from
			the command line. We can make a new file with touch, as we learned.
		</p>
		<p>
			But the new file is empty. To add things to the file, type the following:
		</p>
		<pre>
$ cat >> file.txt
hi
i am using the terminal
hello
the terminal is great</pre
		>
		<p>Then press Control-D to finish adding things to the file.</p>
		<p>Next, try typing in the following:</p>
		<pre>
$ grep terminal file.txt
i am using the terminal
the terminal is great</pre
		>
		<p>
			What the "grep" command does is that it searches for the string "terminal
			in the file a.txt, and print out all lines with the string in it. Try it
			yourself by adding a few more lines to file.txt and run the grep command
			again. See if the output matches with your expectation!
		</p>
		<p>
			One thing that you may want to do is to search through all your files for
			a specific string. Say if you are a student, and you really want to search
			through all your course notes to find the quadratic formula. But there are
			50 chapters of course notes with hundreds of pages in each chapter. What
			you can do is this:
		</p>
		<pre>$ grep -r quadratic .</pre>
		<p>
			What the above grep command does is it will look through all the files
			residing in your current directory, look for the string "quadratic", and
			print them all out along with the filename. The "-r" flag is used to
			indicate that you want to search through every single file in your current
			directory, in every subdirectory, and in every subdirectory of every
			subdirectory etc. Note that the . refers to the current directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			The end.
